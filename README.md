# DecentraFund

## 🧩 Project Description
DecentraFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum.  
It allows project creators to raise ETH directly from supporters without relying on intermediaries.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To empower innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs to fund their ideas transparently using blockchain technology.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Create a Funding Goal:** The project owner sets a target amount in ETH.
- **Contribute ETH:** Supporters can fund the project until the goal is reached.
- **Withdraw or Refund:** The owner withdraws funds once the goal is met; contributors can claim refunds if not.

## 🚀 Core Functions
1. `contribute()` — Allows users to send ETH to fund the project.  
2. `withdrawFunds()` — Enables the project owner to withdraw funds after reaching the goal.  
3. `refund()` — Lets contributors retrieve funds if the goal isn’t achieved.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add deadlines for funding rounds.
- Introduce milestones with partial fund releases.
- Implement DAO-style voting for fund management.
- Integrate with front-end dApps for a seamless user experience.
